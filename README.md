# maze

## about

Maze.cpp is a program that generates a pseudo-random labirinth (maze) and solves it in two different ways. In version maze_1.0 it does just that, but in it is planned to make the maze three-dimensional (add different levels) and to make it more easy to navigate changes in position.

## updates

The program will be finished in a month and updated every week or more frequently.

## use of my code

Maze.cpp was created as a univercity project, so please don't use it for anything but for study.
